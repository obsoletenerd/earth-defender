# Earth Defender

A simple Asteroids clone with updated-but-still-retro graphics.

Made purely to practice Game Maker Studio 2, but I (and my kids) ended up playing it so much that I figured it's worth sharing, or at least storing here for safe keeping.

## How to Play

Download [Earth Defender.zip](https://github.com/obsoletenerd/earth-defender/blob/master/Earth%20Defender.zip), unzip all files to a folder, run the EXE.

Windows 10 only for now, I plan on making builds for MacOS and Linux soon.

If you don't trust the EXE you can clone the repo, then in Game Maker Studio 2 open the YPP file from the Source folder and press F5 to compile and run.

### Keys

* Arrows to turn/move
* SPACE to shoot
* F5 to restart the game at any time
